Undergraduate research paper : 
> ### Development and Evaluation of Personalized E-Learning Application Based on Felder-Silverman Learning Styles.



### Abstract

Recent technological developments in the field of education trigger many innovations, one of the best examples are the emergence of e-Learning. E-Learning provides conveniences in the learning process. One of the innovations is e-Learning that capable to provide personalization for its users. Various research has discussed the development of personalized e-Learning. Unfortunately, most of the research stopped at the interaction design development stage. There are not many studies that studied the application until the implementation stage. Based on the issue, this study focused on the development of personalized e-Learning applications. In this case, the personalized factor is based on Felder-Silverman Learning Styles. This study uses a user-centered design approach in its implementation. The application was developed based on the interaction design of previous research, user demographic, and user interviews. The application was then evaluated by participants in the usability testing stage. Based on the research results, the application has good usability results from the users. Furthermore, this study also proposes recommendations for improvements that can be used in the development of personalized e-Learning applications in the upcoming studies.
